Goal: stay relevant to trending college basketball conversations without stuffing. Use 1-2 tags max.

Daily 5-minute loop (morning + pre-tip)
- Check X trends for sports + search “college basketball”, “NCAA”, “March Madness”, “Bracketology”.
- Scan beat reporters and major CBB accounts; note recurring tags and school-specific tags.
- Look at ESPN/CBB Reddit/Discord headlines to anticipate emerging topics (injury, upset, rivalry).
- Log 3-5 tags and map them to today’s games.

Evergreen tags (use sparingly)
- #CBB #CollegeBasketball #NCAAB #MarchMadness #Bracketology

Team/event tags (rotate)
- Use school abbreviations and mascots when big games: #Zags #RockChalk #NovaNation #Spartans #BoilerUp
- Conference/week events: #Big12, #BigTen, #SEC, #ACC, #BigEast, #MountainWest

Usage rules
- 1-2 hashtags per tweet; never more than 3.
- Prefer placing at the end; keep picks stat-first, hashtag second.
- If a tag is crowded with spam, skip it; a clean stat beats a noisy tag.

Lightweight tracking
- Maintain a running list of tags that drove engagement in kpi_scorecard.
- Note which tags got meaningful replies (not just impressions).
