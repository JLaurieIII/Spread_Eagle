Audience & positioning
- Target: college basketball bettors/degenerates, data-driven fans, and CBB media looking for smart nuggets.
- Promise: fast, insightful edges (totals/sides) plus context that makes followers smarter every day.
- Voice: concise, confident, transparent. Show numbers, avoid bluster. Admit uncertainty.

Tweet formats that perform
- Single stat hook: “UConn pace last 5: 73.8 (up from 68.2). Books still hanging 141.5.”
- Mini-threads (2-4 tweets max): what changed + why it matters + tonight’s angle.
- Visuals: quick charts or screenshots of tempo splits, shot charts, or line moves (brand the image).
- Polls: underdog/over vote, upset alerts, “best over on the slate?” to drive replies.
- Quotes/replies: add value to beat reporters/analysts by appending a stat that completes the story.

Posting cadence (baseline; adapt to slate size)
- Morning (9-11a ET): educational bite or overnight move recap.
- Midday (12-2p): market intelligence or poll.
- Pre-slate (4-6p): first pick/edge with stat reasoning.
- Pre-tip (60-90 mins before big games): second pick/edge or lineup-driven note.
- In-game/reactive: 1-2 tweets with live pace/foul context; retweet key injury confirmations.

Daily workflow (60-90 mins)
1) Scan news/lines: injury reports, travel spots, rest, refs (if legal), line moves vs model.  
2) Pull 3-5 candidate edges: model delta vs market, pace mismatches, foul/FT rate angles.  
3) Draft 4-6 tweets across 2-3 pillars; write one mini-thread.  
4) Run hashtags (hashtag_research) and add 1-2 max; avoid stuffing.  
5) Schedule/queue with 45-90 min spacing; leave 2 open slots for reactive posts.  
6) After posting: reply to 5-10 relevant accounts with added stats; retweet with value-add comments.  
7) Nightly: log performance and save best-performing angles for reuse/reframes.

Quality bar (before posting)
- Does the tweet include a number, comparison, or “why it matters”?
- Can a reader act/learn immediately? If not, tighten.
- Keep screenshots legible and branded; crop out clutter; include source if needed.
- Keep picks transparent: state line and shop timestamp. Avoid overpromising.

Conversion bridge (followers -> app)
- Sprinkle 1 soft CTA per day max: “Full board + live edges in the app.”
- After a strong hit, reply to the tweet with a CTA link instead of editing the original.
- Weekly recap thread: best calls, misses, and what we learned — end with app CTA.
