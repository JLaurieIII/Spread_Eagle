Content pillars (rotate daily; anchor tweets to today’s slate and signals)

1) Sharp signals & tonight’s picks
- Fast fact: ATS/OU trends for marquee games; show line movement vs model edge.
- “If you only watch one game” mini-thread with matchup keys and betting lean.
- Edge framing: “Model has O/U 151.8 vs market 149.5 (+2.3 edge) — why we like over.”

2) Team/coach micro-stories
- Tempo/efficiency quirks, coaching adjustments, lineup changes that affect totals.
- Film/shot-chart insights: “X runs stagger screens to free shooter; pace jumps vs drop coverage.”

3) Market intelligence
- Line moves + why: injury rumor, travel, pace mismatch, ref assignments (where allowed).
- Book vs consensus: show screenshot-style summaries (no illegal data; cite source).

4) Educational bites
- Quick explainers on metrics (tempo, PPP, rim/3 rate, rebounding %, foul rates).
- “How to read…” series: pace splits, back-to-back fatigue, altitude/travel.

5) Social hooks & culture
- Rivalry week angles, bracketology momentum, upset alerts, trap spots.
- Memes/light visuals anchored to real stats (keep respectful).

6) Community & engagement
- Polls: “Most likely upset tonight?” with 2-3 underdogs.
- “Your best CBB edge tonight?” quote/reply prompts to boost interaction.
