Track weekly to see what moves the needle. Log quickly; consistency beats precision.

Core metrics (weekly)
- Followers change
- Profile visits
- Engagement rate (likes + replies + RTs) / impressions
- Link clicks (to app or site)
- Best-performing tweet (link + why it worked)
- Worst-performing tweet (link + fix to test)

Example table
| Week of | Followers start | Followers end | Top tweet link | Top tweet type | Top hashtags | Notes/insights | Next experiments |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-01-12 | 1,000 | 1,180 | ... | Pick / stat hook | #CBB | Tempo mismatch angle hit; replies drove reach | Add poll to stat hook; test 2 visuals |

Experiment backlog (quick ideas)
- Add poll to pre-tip pick.
- Quote-tweet beat reporters with one stat that changes the story.
- Try “If you only watch one game…” mini-thread with CTA in reply.
- Test visual styles: shot chart vs pace/efficiency bar.
- Timing test: pre-tip vs 90 mins prior for big games.
